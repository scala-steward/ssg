 * Scala.js implementation of file operations using Node.js' fs module.
 *
 * This mirrors the JVM reference (scalajvm/ssg/commons/io/FileOpsPlatform.scala) operation-for-operation:
 * readAllBytes/writeBytes/exists/isDirectory/isRegularFile, each delegating to the synchronous fs APIs
 * (readFileSync/writeFileSync/existsSync/statSync) that are the Node analogue of java.nio.file.Files.
 *
 * The fs module is acquired through a lazy `require("fs")` (same discipline as ssg-md's
 * scalajs PlatformResourcesImpl after ISS-979) so that loading this module in a browser bundle — where
 * `require` is absent — does not crash at module-init time. `isSupported` reflects exactly that:
 * true when Node fs is actually available (the test/runtime environment), false in a browser.
 *
 * Buffer <-> Array[Byte] conversion is byte-exact for binary content: an Int8Array view is laid over the
 * Buffer's backing ArrayBuffer so each signed byte round-trips without reinterpretation.
 *
 * Semantic differences from the JVM reference (declared honestly):
 *  - A missing-file read throws on JVM as java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException; on Node, readFileSync throws an
 *    ENOENT error that surfaces to Scala as scala.scalajs.js.JavaScriptException. Both propagate (no swallow),
 *    matching the JVM contract that reading an absent file fails rather than returning empty.
